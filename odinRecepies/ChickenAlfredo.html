    <h2 class="food-ingredient-header">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="food-ingredient-list">
      <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>8 ounces fettuccine pasta</li>
      <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="food-instruction-header">Instructions:</h2>
    <ol class="food-ingredient-list">
      <li>Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the
        chicken breasts and cook for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until
        they are cooked through and no longer pink in the center. Remove the
        chicken from the skillet and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1 minute,
        or until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat to medium and pour in the heavy cream. Bring it to a
        simmer and let it cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and continue to cook until the sauce
        thickens, about 2-3 minutes. Season with additional salt and pepper if
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the sauce is simmering, cook the fettuccine pasta according to the
        package instructions. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>Slice the cooked chicken breasts into thin strips.</li>
      <li>
        Add the cooked fettuccine pasta to the skillet with the Alfredo sauce
        and toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve the pasta topped with sliced chicken breasts and garnish with
        chopped fresh parsley.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="food-notes">Notes:</h2>
    <ul class="food-notes-list">
      <li>
        You can add steamed broccoli or sautéed mushrooms to the dish for extra
        flavor and nutrition.
      </li>
      <li>
        For a lighter version, you can use half-and-half instead of heavy cream,
        but the sauce may be less rich.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leftover chicken alfredo can be stored in an airtight container in the
        refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove top or in the
        microwave, adding a splash of milk or cream to loosen the sauce if
        needed.
      </li>

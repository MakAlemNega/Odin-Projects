    <h2 class="food-ingredient-header">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="food-ingredient-list">
      <li>12 ounces spaghetti</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>4 slices bacon, diced</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="food-instruction-header">Instructions</h2>
    <ol class="food-instruction-list">
      <li>
        In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta according to package
        instructions; reserve 1 cup of water and drain well.
      </li>
      <li>In a small bowl, whisk together eggs and Parmesan; set aside.</li>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add bacon and cook until
        brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes; reserve excess fat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Working quickly, stir in pasta and egg mixture, and gently toss to
        combine; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Add reserved pasta
        water, one tablespoon at a time, until desired consistency is reached.
      </li>
      <li>Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="food-notes">Notes</h2>
    <ul class="food-notes-list">
      <li>
        For a creamier sauce, you can add a splash of heavy cream to the egg and
        Parmesan mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Feel free to substitute pancetta for the bacon for a more authentic
        Italian flavor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure to work quickly when combining the pasta with the egg mixture
        to prevent the eggs from scrambling.

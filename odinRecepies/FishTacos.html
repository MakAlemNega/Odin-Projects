    <h2 class="food-ingredient-header">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="food-ingredient-list">
      <li>1 lb white fish fillets (such as cod or tilapia)</li>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
      <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
      <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>8 small corn or flour tortillas</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded cabbage</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
      <li>1/4 cup diced red onion</li>
      <li>1/4 cup diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="food-instruction-header">Instructions:</h2>
    <ol class="food-ingredient-list">
      <li>Cut the fish fillets into bite-sized pieces.</li>
      <li>In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, paprika, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper.</li>
      <li>Pour the buttermilk into another shallow bowl.</li>
      <li>Dip each piece of fish into the buttermilk, then coat it in the flour mixture. Shake off any excess flour.</li>
      <li>Heat about 1 inch of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot (about 350°F), fry the fish pieces in batches until golden brown and cooked through, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
      <li>Warm the tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave.</li>
      <li>Assemble the tacos by placing a few pieces of fried fish on each tortilla. Top with shredded cabbage, cilantro, red onion, tomatoes, and a dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt. Squeeze fresh lime juice over the top.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="food-notes">Notes:</h2>
    <ul class="food-notes-list">
      <li>You can customize the toppings to your liking. Add avocado slices, jalapeños, or a spicy sauce for extra flavor.</li>
      <li>If you prefer a healthier option, you can bake the fish instead of frying it. Preheat the oven to 400°F and bake the coated fish pieces on a greased baking sheet for about 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through.</li>
